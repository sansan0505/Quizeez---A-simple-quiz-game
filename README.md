# Quizeez: A simple quiz game

QUIZEEZ is a software through which we can conduct a quiz program.
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive quiz game software using Python programming language, coupled with MySQL database for storing and retrieving quiz questions and user data. The software will provide an engaging platform for users to test their knowledge on various topics, track their scores, and improve their quiz-taking skills. The UI is quiet simple and easy to use. The users can register using their name. Admins are able to add new questions on entering a code.

# Modules

1. home:- This module is used to display the homepage

    new_player:- Using this module the user can enter their name and start the quiz

2. add:- Using this module the admin can add questions

3. level1:- Questions from level 1

4. level2:- Questions from level 2

5. level3:- Questions from level 3


Note: Create a database 'quiz' with the questions before proceeding with the python code
